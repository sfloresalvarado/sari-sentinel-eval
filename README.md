 SARI sentinel surveillance assessment

ABOUT THE DATASETS

SARI surveillance data and hospitalization data from UGCC (centralized bed management unit) is not open data. It can be accessed under requirement to the Ministry of Health. 

To test the scripts, we provide a dataset that combines real open COVID-19 data, with synthetic data that replaces SARI and UGCC sentinel surveillance information that is not available in government repositories.

To access open data in its original source, you can visit the following links:
